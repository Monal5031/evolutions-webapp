> A react app to view pokemon evolution chain.

### Motivation
CLI version of this tool is available in [evolutions](https://github.com/anshumanv/evolutions). So we needed something interactive.

### Usage
* Simply enter either the pokemon `name` or `ID` in the text field on the landing page and click `Evolve` to view the evolution chain of the entered pokemon.
* Clicking on `I'm Feeling Hype` will display the evolution chain of a randomnly picked pokemon.
